# About this course:
###
The course includes five modules. In each module, there'll be a set of lecture videos, together with a set of review questions or exercise to help you make sure you've mastered the material. The later modules include hands-on exercises in which you'll get to apply the course material. When you complete the course, you'll come away with the understanding of how real world data science problems can be modeled as graphs along with various tools and techniques.

If you have friends who might be interested in graph analytics, please consider recommending this course to others. If you and your friends form a “study group” and work together to learn about graph analytics technologies and applications, that would likely make the experience more fun, and help you learn more quickly too. Welcome again to the Graph Analytics for Big Data course and enjoy learning about these technologies - some of the most sought after skills today in the technology industry. We hope that this course will help you on your road to using technology to gain insight from Big Data.
